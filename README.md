Small Mac App to quickly open a folder in Atom from the Finder.

## Installation
Download the folder by Clicking on ["Download Zip"](https://github.com/riberi/Open-with-Atom/archive/master.zip) on the right sidebar.

Then drag-and-drop the "Open with Atom" application to the /Applications folder.  
Once it's in there, maintain the command (âŒ˜) key, and drag-and-drop the application into your toolbar.

## Notes
* This is a quick AppleScript, heavily inspired by some old version of "Open with Sublime 2".
* I'm currently evaluating several code editors / IDE. This feature could be a deal breaker, so I made this small tool to give Atom a fair chance.
* Depending on feedback, this project may need to be cleaned up. And will probably be redeveloped from the ground up.
